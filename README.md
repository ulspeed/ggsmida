ggsmida
=======
ggsmida is a very simple WebRTC application. It realises the functions below:

1 message chat

2 video chat

3 files sharing

This application is for my personal study of WebRTC. It references another WebRTC application: SonotoneJS.

To test this application, it needs to install NodeJS firstly.

Then, to install websocket plugin, use command: $ npm install

To run the demo server: $ node server.js
